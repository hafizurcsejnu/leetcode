async vs defer
-------------------

Async - means execute code when it is downloaded and do not block DOM construction during downloading process. Defer - means execute code after it's downloaded and browser finished DOM construction and rendering process.

Async
Downloads in the background at a low priority (same as defer)
Can interrupt page rendering to execute
Executes as soon as possible and in no particular order

Defer
Downloads in the background at a low priority (same as async)
Won't interrupt page rendering to execute
Executes in sequence just before the DOMContentLoaded event
